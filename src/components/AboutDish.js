            <p>Rinderbraten is a dish that you will usually get served when visiting the grand parents or on a special occasion.</p>

            <p>To prepare a Rinderbraten you will need some high quality piece of beef and a lot of time.</p>

            <p>The meat is put in the oven and cooked slowly in its juices for hours and hours.</p>

            <p>But the slow cooking in low heat will make the meat incredibly soft and tender.</p>

            <p>Traditionally Sp√§tzle are a great side dish for Rinderbraten as the perfectly soak up all the juices and the sauce to add for even more flavour.</p>
